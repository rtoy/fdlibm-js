fdlibm-js
=========

A port of fdlibm to Javascript.

fdlibm is Sun's open source implementation of libm. It includes most
of the standard C functions defined in libm.  However, this port only
includes the special functions.

The goal of this port is to provide a reference implementation of
these functions in Javascript.  The port strives to be fairly close to
the original implementation achieving the same accuracy as the
original while also striving to be reasonably fast in Javascript.
